1. Merits of (fast, digital lookup avaiable by e.g. Twitch service) vs (“cabin in the woods” retreat sessions) — former replicates the computer’s everything-has-a-stat experience, but in a slower, inferior method; latter offers something unique, which can’t be provided by computer (the fuzzy logic of WHEN to reference DM charts vs when to hand-wave it, either for rule-of-cool or simple maintenance of pace/cadence.) Is the complexity of 3.X in fact an unexpected benefit here, due to its tendency to overwhelm the DM with [charts/edge-case modifiers] and have them fall back on “fuck it, that should probably be about a +6”?
