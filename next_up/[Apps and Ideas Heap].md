1. ~~Fix your system for delivering "Other People's Lines."~~

1. ~~Use 'dmware' as the name for your adventure event-scaffolding software~~

1. Use noun project API to create "conversation starters" for video sessions
   (e.g. speakers tell a story based on randomly-generated pics) Options: - timed/untimed - number of images (either choose one from three, or must integrate entire set into story?) - Image categories - Bring in various Faker-generated sentences as prompts (use e.g. quotes Classes, rather than single-word entries) https://github.com/stympy/faker

1. A program that creates (e.g. noun-verb) collocates based on pairs that rarely/never collocate (idea-prompting sample: “the clocks delectate.”)

1. ~~Idiomatic: app for learning individual vocabulary via SRS, introduced and retrieved via idioms/collocations that make use of that vocab item. (Cross-reference vocab frequency against containing idiom’s frequency; perhaps narrow by discipline i.e. travel, conversation, business, academic.) Ignore phrasals. (Idiomate?)~~

1. ~~SRS vocab searcher: present the vocabulary in the context of a sentence taken from real-life media.~~ 
    * ~~(Second challenge: create a sentence using the media, with translation. Save that sentence as well, then add it to the list of sentences to be called back.)~~
    * ~~Alt: maybe the app returns daily incidences of (the words/phrases that you had added) as they appear in the daily media—thus creating a de facto frequency list?~~

1. Background app that prompts, after reading an article, whether you want to engage with the article in a language you’re learning (via e.g. vocab, grammar, etc Q’s -- all very brief, though w/o banning constructed response). After Q, option to add topic to SRS mechanism (or move to next Q). Designed for business EN learning -- working adults who are too busy to maintain classes, but want to choose exactly when to practice a language, and otherwise not have it in their way. (This app could also accept articles to draw exercises from: the above would merely be “passive presentation” mode.)

1. SRS task: you are presented with a sentence that you wrote, which has an error in it; you must click the area with the error, and correct it to match \${whatever correction was given by the instructor}. If needed, a prompt of the error type (as tagged by instructor) can be provided.

1. ~~[Inspired by this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12849195/rails-capture-method/15229531#15229531) (as an example to adapt or link to), create a clone of Ruby (&Rails?) documentation that links to a better (more detailed, with more examples of common use-cases) explanations via SO/blog posts.~~

1. App for TBLT Materials: build an (extension? Web app?) that creates supports for authentic online texts: use “elaborated” input (Long, 2009) that includes linguistic supports, such as redundancy, paraphrasing, synonyms, clear signaling, and marking to increase topic salience, making the information flow chronologically, using shorter sentences, and so on.(From the National Academies’ Improving Adult Literacy Instruction)

1. SMS-based Adult Literacy curriculum

   - Use emoji as multimedia component, to prompt/associate/describe basic words.
   - Or the [Noun Project’s](https://thenounproject.com/browse/) svg’s?
   - Or [ManyPixel's](https://gallery.manypixels.co/) svg's?

1. SMS-based daily speaking prompts.

   - Delivered by voice recording + optional supplementary text,
   - using push notifications/email.
   - Prompt contains topic;
   - user records impromptu speech;
   - human listener (cheap \$ in EastEur) uses SR-form to
     - write/send targeted feedback, and
     - select links for user to engage in controlled practice.
   - Variations:
     - every other day is VoIP role-play;
     - two chances to record: once w/o prep, at beginning of day, and once after receiving 5-10 potentially-useful vocabulary words.

1. ~~Apply corpus analysis to OER: create content-based instruction courses by building complementary language curriculum around most commonly-occurring structures ("words and rules") in each text.~~

1. GUI for content professors: (experts in research, but not pedagogy) to build lessons, guided by sound teaching principles and pleasing design.

   - (_Note you have two reaaaaaal ugly back-of-the-napkin wireframe illustrations for this in_ `./static`)
   - Sold to universities: align with institution-unique accreditation requirements.
     - Software that takes an instructor from subject matter expert tune near-professional educator, by scaffolding their building of lesson plans, assessments, and syllabi.
     - “Valuable subjects change so quickly in this field (tech); this software works with an expert in that field to create a replicable, distributable, project/portfolio-based curriculum,  so you can offer courses that will get your graduates jobs.”
   - How to make lesson planning easier, faster, more certain?
   - Help teachers defend decisions with research (i.e. engage with and protect against parents & admin)
   - UI for \[content and activity\] selection (for touchscreen access)
   - Track \[content and activity\]-types across lessons (by week, unit, semester etc)

1. Software for (IEP? K-12 content? HE content?) students to each curate a portfolio which starts empty, but is used for weekly (open-classroom/group-based) check-in’s (to gamify and level set, so students don’t fall behind from lack of context.)

   - Include easy multimedia scraping (for web-based media as e.g. prompts or interests) and easy multimedia uploading (specifically video and text.)
   - Pre-load the platform with tasks for  teachers to use or adapt; align those tasks to e.g. the EAQUALS/CEFR frameworks.
   - (Be sure to require uploaded media of dialogues/role-plays between students, so tasks don’t  become too monologic.)

1. ~~Online platform for abstracting and facilitating partnerships between community colleges and local businesses (around internships, job shadow, adjunct faculty, curriculum design, etc.) Similar to docusign or trinet or workday in terms of templates and easy-accessibility web-based data management.~~

1. ~~Software for (IEP? K-12 content?

1. Anki’s SRS format displaying sentences, but with the ability to highlight particular words/phrases to practice them (or similar instances of them) further.

1. ~~Program to parse reoccuring parts of speech/collocations within a preexisting textbook (so as to build a course/lesson around it.)~~

1. ~~For a ‘language maintenance @ 10 min daily’ app...~~
   ~~- combine daily_ua idea w/ ability @ tap to send to SRS, and~~
   ~~- (icon-based?) prompts for video-lesson conversation, based around~~
     ~~1. upcoming language in SRS, and~~
     ~~2. recent language in newsreader.~~
   ~~- Side note: adult learners of \* as a Foreign Language are either doing it~~
     ~~1. For business/academic interests, with a goal, and likely a time constraint: and, thus, hardcore (i.e. taking structured courses), or~~
     ~~2. For personal interest, without a time constraint: and, thus, with more soft requirements (i.e. interest is at least partially cultural engagement, intrinsic.)~~

1. Corpus builder: software that sequences a series of different pictures/narratives with different time frames, etc, adjustable by the people building the corpus in order to record different parts of the two languages’ unique traits. (For instance: "Korean has these various honorific ways of speaking, but in English verb chronological sequence is very important--what are the unmarked forms of both of these in relation to their language?")
