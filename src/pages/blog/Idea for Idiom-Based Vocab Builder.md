## What Are We Doing Here?

> `"Idiomatic: app for learning individual vocabulary via SRS, introduced and retrieved via idioms/collocations that make use of that vocab item. (Cross-reference vocab frequency against containing idiom’s frequency; perhaps narrow by discipline i.e. travel, conversation, business, academic.) Ignore phrasals. (Idiomate?)"`

<!-- for UA, at least, no way to know frequency w/o paying, and even then not terribly robust dataset -->
