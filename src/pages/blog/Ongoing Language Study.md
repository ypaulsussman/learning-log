### Where We've Come From

I first began with assignments to read articles in Ukrainian. This was an excellent source of new vocabulary, but the quantity of new lexis was overwhelming, so retention was poor. Moreover, my interest in the content, combined with the size of the articles, caused me to spend more time with a focus on meaning (_in the Michael Long sense_) than I would have preferred.

I then moved to translating sentences that my instructor (far better in English the nine Ukrainian) would construct and email to me. This enabled me to pay more attention to form-meaning interactions, but had three downsides. 

First, the language I engaged with often constituted levels of complexity well outside the (admittedly idealized) “i + 1”  buffer zone for maximal optimal uptake and learning. This would most frequently manifest on the far side of that theoretical region: I would often translate low-frequency, accuracy-demanding collocations or idioms.

The precision of these linguistic bundles exacerbated the limitations of written corrective feedback. I couldn’t, for instance, synchronously request whether a correction was due to an extrapolatable rule, or a fossilized, unique quirk of history; nor could I provide several analogous cases to confirm my intuitions of proper use based on that feedback.

To be clear, these set expressions would, in themselves, still be enjoyable and valuable to learn, even despite the scarcity of reactive feedback and available time to study (_and corollary importance of aligning target language to specific communicative needs._) What compounded the issue was the difficulty in returning to meaningfully engage with any previous week’s homework: and, thus, to successfully include any of its contents in long-term memory.

### Where We're At

From those demands has evolved the current system, and I’m largely happy with how it’s performed for the last several months. Currently, each week I:

1. Spend half an hour (_on laptop_) writing approximately 5-10 sentences in Ukrainian, along with (_what I hope to somewhat-accurately be_) their English translations;
1. Email those sentences to my tutor;
1. Engage in a two-hour video lesson (_on laptop_) with said tutor on a weekend morning, during which...
  * We begin with free conversation; any errors are highlighted for learner self-correction, and new/grasped-for language is provided.
  * At the tutor's discretion/learner's request, any lexical/morphosyntactic items from either stream can be typed into the text-chat for storage.
  * We move to reviewing the Ukrainian sentences, with the learner reading off each sentence and the tutor prompting self-correction of errors (_and, sometimes, providing targeted pronunciation drilling._)
  * We return to free conversation, now consciously attempting to weave the incidentally-occurring lexis and prior errors into both our speech.
1. After the lesson, I'll add the (_now-corrected_) Ukrainian sentences from the week's homework to Anki, with their English equivalent as the prompt. (_Also... on laptop._)
1. I'll pay for the video lessons, and schedule new ones (_wait for it: on mobile, through italki's hilariously counterintuitive native app._)
1. Throughout the coming week, I'll spend ~5min each morning practicing the cards presented by Anki's system (_on mobile._)
1. Finally, returning to the top of this list, I'll try to weave 10-20 of the items encountered during the lesson into the coming week's sentences.

That ends up being around three hours a week, two of which are (_at least partially_) conversing with a human I like and would probably chat away with anyway. I think that's a reasonable expenditure to stave off language attrition... if, in fact, that's what it's having any success doing. (_I can hope, but it's not like I'd be willing to shell out to annually take the Ukrainian equivalent of the IELTS, even were such an exam to meaningfully exist._)

### Where We Might Go

I had planned for this section to outline a unified app, one that combined my current workflow into a single mobile interface.

Usefully, though, I began with a reflection on what I’m currently doing, and how that set of practices has evolved: a reflection that has prompted me to realize, now, just how little would be gained by integrating all functionality into a single app.

When I think through the greatest pain points in my ongoing system, what comes to mind is the seemingly-superfluous second password request on attempting to schedule a lesson within the italki app (_followed only by the difficulty in actually reaching the “schedule lesson” interface from that app's dashboard._)

On contemplation, there’s never been a case where I had wished for a more seamless transition of data from one device or program to another. So much for that angle!

### So What, Now What? 

There is a very possible future weakness of my current system, and it hinges on a parallel realization I'd had while writing.

Anecxperidotally, adult learners of `/* as a Foreign Language/` are either doing it...
1. for business/academic interests, in which case they usually have both
  * a specific and falsifiable performance goal, and 
  * a specific and falsifiable time constraint: and, thus, 
  * a fairly rigorous learning schedule (_i.e. they're taking structured courses, attending an immersion program, etc._), or
2. for personal/cultural/intrinsic interest, in which case they
  * are operating without a time constraint,
  * don't have (_summative or formative_) performance benchmarks they're checking against, and
  * perhaps paradoxically* are at greater risk of lapse due to quotidian interference.

I'm firmly, firmly in the latter camp, currently: however, if I shifted into the former (_let's say that long-awaited faculty appointment to [Ivan Franko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lviv) finally came through, or_ `${lovely_spouse}` _took an unexpected interest in the ecological preservation of the Eastern Carpathians..._) I'm not sure how I'd shift into high-gear, as it were. 

I'd prefer not to redesign (_who are we kidding, re-evolve_) a language-learning system that worked for me, especially given the expected additional constraints/features that the greater intensity/pace would demand.

It'd be nice, instead, if there were a "_ramp up/ramp down_" mechanic, akin to those selectable by e.g. treadmills. I'm not thinking of increasing the pace of memorization -- that ignores the logic/evidence of SRS algorithms to date -- but rather supplementing it with several parallel, cross-referential exercises. The first two that come to mind would be


For a ‘language maintenance @ 10 min daily’ app...
* combine daily_ua idea w/ ability @ tap to send to SRS, and
* (icon-based?) prompts for video-lesson conversation, based around
  * upcoming language in SRS, and
  * recent language in newsreader.

* Or just counterfactually. Again, anecxperidotal.
