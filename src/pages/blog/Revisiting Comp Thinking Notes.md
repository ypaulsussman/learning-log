## What Are We Doing Here, Again? 

Back in the summer of 2017, I participated in the [Twin Cities Startup Weekend Education](http://communities.techstars.com/usa/twincities/startup-weekend/10569); I still get a smile every time I dip by the site of [the team I helped with!](http://codekitty.org/) While I moved on after a few months (_I was more interested in teacher-training than direct-to-K-6 workshops, and my own work simultaneously started up a new, more-demanding project_), during my time contributing I did a pretty comprehensive review of the literature around inculcating computational-thinking skills.

One goal I have for this blog is to prompt cyclical returns to previous work, after an arbitrary time of reflection and maturation. That is, I'd like each post to end with a "_so what / now what?_" next-steps list: one I could return to several weeks (_months?_) down the road, with fresh eyes, greater skills, or even a freer schedule. The first three-dozen or so posts I'd brought over to populate the `Notes` section of this blog, however, lack that prompt (_challenge?_) to future-self... that's what I'd like these "_Revisitations_" to produce.
