### Issues in Language Learning Strategy Research and Teaching (Chamot 2004)

[Available here.](http://e-flt.nus.edu.sg/v1n12004/chamot.pdf)

*   The _Strategy Inventory for Language Learning_ (SILL), Oxford (1990), is the most common questionnaire.
*   Language-learning strategy classification schemes have generally been developed for research purposes... little attention has been paid to students’ learning goals or teachers’ instructional goals.
*   we do not know...whether female or male students are most in need of language learning strategies
*   More proficient language learners use a greater variety and often a greater number of learning strategies
*   language teachers need to find out what learning strategies students are already using for the different tasks they undertake
*   Explicit learning-strategy instruction essentially involves...
    *   the development of students’ awareness of the strategies they use,
    *   teacher modeling of strategic thinking,
    *   student practice with new strategies,
    *   student self-evaluation of the strategies used, and
    *   practice in transferring strategies to new tasks

*   Most researchers... agree on the importance of explicitness in strategy instruction
*   the issue of language of instruction in teaching language learning strategies is far from resolved... 
        * give the strategy a target language name, 
        * explain how to use it in simple language, and 
        * repeatedly model the strategy
*   A number of models for teaching learning strategies...share many features.

*   importance of developing students’ metacognitive understanding of the value of learning strategies... facilitated through teacher demonstration and modeling.
*   importance of providing multiple practice opportunities with the strategies so that students can use them autonomously.
*   students should evaluate how well a strategy has worked, choose strategies for a task, and actively transfer strategies to new tasks.

### Language Learning Strategy Instruction: Current Issues and Research (Chamot 2005)

[Available here.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annual-review-of-applied-linguistics/article/language-learning-strategy-instruction-current-issues-and-research/6882EFF43DCE89D3331DC2F3CFF31595/core-reader#)

*   Once a learning strategy becomes familiar through repeated use, it may be used with some automaticity, but most learners will, if required, be able to call the strategy to conscious awareness.
*   Learning strategies are sensitive to the learning context and to the learner’s internal processing preferences.

*   If learners perceive, for example, that a task like vocabulary learning requires correct matching of a new word to its definition within a specified period of time (as in a test), they will likely decide to use a memorization strategy.

*   importance of not overlooking students’ current learning strategies, careful choice of tasks for practicing learning strategies, and providing explicit and embedded learning strategy instruction.
*   There are several current models for strategy identification, development, and instruction

*   self-management model includes five metacognitive strategies: plan, monitor, evaluate, problem-solve, and implement.
*   five-stage interactive process that includes planning, selecting and using learning strategies, monitoring strategy use, orchestrating various strategies, and evaluating the strategies used.
