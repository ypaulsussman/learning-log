## What Are We Doing Here?

This document is a weird one: it’s notes from a review-of-the-literature white paper that... apparently I had elected to read for fun? Sometime in the middle of my first salaried ~~development~~ (_phrasing!_) programming job?

Whatever my motives -- and I’m not being coy when I say, a year and a half on, they are entirely obscure to me -- I've done nothing with the material inside over the intervening 18 months. No application to toy apps, no usage in the classroom... completely unreferenced.

<!-- almost wanted to skip this guy, but had gone so long w/o education/linguistics revisitation that decided to pull thorugh. very glad i did, though for unexpected reasons -->

## Revisitation

A meta-observation, or note on process: I felt that in this revisitation I engaged more deeply, more granularly with the content than in some prior. I believe this stemmed from these notes' need for a broad, detailed reorganization and trimming. Bluntly: they were an unstructured, dispersed, digressive mess. 

And, ultimately? I suspect this made the revisitation more protracted, less superficial, and mentally more rewarding. One takeaway for the future, then — facilitated, already, by the clipping feature of the Kindle I now largely use — is to be liberal, when in doubt, in choosing what to highlight.

By contrast, revisiting this set of notes drove home the annoyance and lack of benefit from my earlier (_now-abandoned_) attempts to maintain (_at least a facsimile of_) APA-style citations. So many unnecessary periphrastic brackets... just cut the damn thing up and rephrase already! Go wild! Live a little!

<!-- ironically, perhaps, the thickest section (and one I got the most out of) was the literacy-irrelevant, skill-neutral overview on Things What Work Best® in the world of instructional design. if nothing else, there's plenty I can apply here as i neurotically attempt to perpetually measure and refine my own processes of autodidacticism. yeah, that sounds healthy: read a list of how to design things to help others... then curl up on your couch and apply them to yourself. NOICE! -->

<!-- beginning to toy with adult literacy development as ersatz proxy or mental analog for process of learning to code: if you haven't learned former as child, then: similar level of cognitive demand; similar reliance on several skills (each integrated to varying degrees); several in-use, preexisting sources of potential interference; several functional levels of proficiency (rather than binary.) not sure exactly how far to take analogy, or how to apply it, or whether to focus more on areas in which the equivalence breaks down -- but definitely  a comparison to mull over further-->

Coming on the heels of my navel-gazing about the tension and tradeoffs between perfecting pedagogical efficacy [vs] expanding and buttressing the basic social affordances that make such considerations even relevant for a given institution (_see "Revisiting How the Brain Learns"_), this report was refreshingly clear about what it considers the most important aspect of instruction.

## Next Steps

<!-- can't do much for the above: not crazy about emulating big-tobacco advertising for education<sub>wow i'm old; can't even make that reference anymore! should've referred to facebook</sub> advertising, and can't singlehandledly tweak state/federal stipends for learners. for the other three, though, plenty to think about: and, reassuringly for my ego, many involving potential toy apps  -->

<!-- more valid ways of measuring adults’ literacy gains: CASAS item generator app -->

<!-- investigate the underlying cognitive, social, and cultural mechanisms involved in online reading, writing, and learning: ...? -->

<!-- free literacy practice from being dependent on a specific learning location: many students use YouTube for EN clips on their phone -- build off that platform (or vimeo), with links in the bottom to a web URL with quiz? use auto CC'ing to provide text, then question extraction from text to semi-automatically generate questions? still would need human editor -- but could cut down on human cognitive toll -->

<!-- ties into final one, overcome the high cost of intelligent human labor, in this case literacy instructors: think of stuff in teachers' lounge -- how much of it requires _more_ effort to apply than whatever the default for the lesson would be? by that logic, any teacher-support app is useless unless it decreases, substantially, the amount of work the teacher needs to do. first thing that comes to mind on my end is material-surfacing (esp by e.g. theme or standard); second is prompts to speed up task creation (while simultaneously guiding/encouraging the teacher to integrate best practices e.g. listed in `Principles of Learning for Instructional Design`...)-->
