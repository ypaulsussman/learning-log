## What Are We Doing Here?

<!-- 1. Program to parse reoccuring parts of speech/collocations within a preexisting textbook (so as to build a course/lesson around it.) -->



I like the idea of a natural language processor that would scrape the digital copy of a textbook for all its phrasal verbs, or collocations, or [content words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word) below a certain frequency level, and then:
1. make a list of the frequency with which each lexical item occurs, then 
2. check to see if there are any cases where a given item is an equally distributed across the book (that is, perhaps occurring exclusively in chapter 9, or occurring with three times as much frequency in the first four chapters of the book as the last eight), then
3. step would be to call out to pre-existing TEFL text books, find where any exercises are for that particular color item, and either link back to that textbook by page Number/citation, or provide the actual content.

Alternatively, instead of being a b2c for students, b2b for publishers? or schools? (and if the former, which dept: engineering, or continuing studies/bridge program?)
