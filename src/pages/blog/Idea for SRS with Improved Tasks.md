## What Are We Doing Here?

>`[1] SRS format displaying sentences, but with the ability to highlight particular words to practice them further (in different sentences).`
>
>`[2] SRS task:Â you are presented with a sentence which now contains an error. You must click the area with the error, and correct. If needed, a prompt of the error type (as tagged by instructor) can be provided. Repetitions spread timing, but also change the content words to prevent easy recognition of the error.`
