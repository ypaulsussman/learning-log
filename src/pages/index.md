## What are we doing here?

Well I know what _I'm_ doing here!

I wanted to “start a blog”: more specifically, I wanted to build (or adapt) a small, low-investment codebase that would impel me to write down more of my thoughts.

My reactions to media I've consumed, my ideas for projects that I may even someday start, my observations on unbidden stimuli as the universe rolls past... I don't have a ton of confidence in _their_ intrinsic value, but I feel pretty good about the mental exercise that I predict \${recording those thoughts, and while recording sharpening them} will bring.

## But how does a blog help?

I keenly feel EB White's complaint:

> “If the world were merely seductive, that would be easy. If it were merely challenging, that would be no problem. But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.”

Compounding this, I’m concerned by both \${the dubiousness of my efforts to improve the world} and \${the discrepancies in mapping self-improvement - the point of this blog - to world-improvement}.

And, in parallel: I know I'm very, very skilled at enjoying the world.

## So what to do?

This blog, then, turns on an contradiction: I don't _want_ anyone to see this.

In technical terms, it's vaguely embarrassing. I mean, [take a look yourself:](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/learning-log) it’s essentially a slash-and-burn adapatation of [Netlify’s Gatsby CMS starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms), except...

- there’s a shameful amount of DRY-violation in the components;
- the GraphQL’s been modified without the slightest understanding of how that language actually works, or how to optimize it;
- the styling roughly translates to “_import the lightest-weight columns-and-components library you can find, then write a bunch of contradictory overrides_”... woof. This list could go on.

And yet.

For all that, this blog **needs** to be (_at least hypothetically!_) visible to others, to force me to continue thinking about it, and contributing to it, and refining it. 

So, while the intent here is purely selfish - a spur for my own extracurricular, professional, personal development - I do need you to exist, if only as a possibility.

A stick to the carrot of `${writing and coding for fun}`.

A friendly threat, from a well-meaning neighbor.

Thank you, reader, for for stopping by. :)

## OK, sure, cool, whatever. What’s next?

I'm weighing the (_as-yet-unreplicated?_) [warnings against sharing goals publicly](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/09_Gollwitzer_Sheeran_Seifert_Michalski_When_Intentions_.pdf) with, again, the hope that knowing this is available on the public internet will terrify me into slowly iterating through them. So how do I want to improve this site?

- You've converted perhaps three-dozen notes from Google Docs to Markdown, but none of them involve any commentary on the books, sites, lectures, workshops. Write some posts a la "_Revisiting notes from \${text}, several months on_".
- You have several pages of \${toy app, doctoral thesis, research project, distance learning startup} ideas remaining in Docs. Markdownify those, disaggregate, and expand.
- As you begin implementing some of those above toy apps, take notes on what you do and what you learn.
